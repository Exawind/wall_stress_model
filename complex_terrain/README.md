## Overview
This directory contains the files and data for running the flow over a two-dimensional ridge and
and flow over a three-dimensional hill

## Basic settings

| Parameter       | Value                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Reynolds number | 10600 based on hill height |
| Hill height     | 1 m                        |
| Fluid density   | 1 kg/m^3                   |
| Fluid velocity  | 1 m/s                      |
| Fluid viscosity | 10600                      |
|                 |                            |
